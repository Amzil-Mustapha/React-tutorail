## This repo contains exercises and tasks that I did when I was studying ReactJs.


### LoadingDataTrick.jsx
- This Component displays the word "loading" before it downloads the data from the link and also checks whether the data has been loaded correctly before displaying it to the user

### DeleteItemInArray.jsx
- This Component displays a list containing a group of items. The user can delete any selected item

### ShortCircuit.jsx
- This Component displays the Cases in which Short-Circuit evaluation (&& - ||) is used and a basics explanation thereof

### Forms.jsx
- This Component displays how controled inputs in react function components

### AddItemsToList.jsx
- This Component displays how to add items to a list and clear the list

### MultipleInputs.jsx
- Like AddItemsToList component, but in this component all inputs are controlled by one changeHandler function and this method is used in case there are a large number of inputs

### UseRef.jsx
- This component uses a combination of state and refs. Both startTime and now are state variables because they are used for rendering. But we also need to hold an interval ID so that we can stop the interval on button press. Since the interval ID is not used for rendering, it’s appropriate to keep it in a ref, and manually update it.

### Folder useReducer
- This folder It contains the component UseReducer that adds items to the list via the UseReducer hook and when adding the item a modal appears written on it 'item added' and after three seconds it disappears, the model is also a component

### UseContext.jsx
- This Component displays how useContext Hook work with simple exemple
